## Features

Several technologies are combined to make this work:

- [Spring MVC](https://spring.io/)
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site -P development
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

### Database

The application requires a Neo4j database. Use the provided docker image for development.

### Docker image

For the database:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.db.yml up
```

This will start a Neo4j database, with the dashboard available at [http://localhost:7474/](http://localhost:7474/). And the backend, available at http://localhost:8080.

For the backend:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Running with Spring Boot

This requires running the database Docker image first.

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run -P development -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=initialize
```

### Running the tests

The project requires a database and a server for being able to run the integration tests.

Just like running the project, an embedded server with an in-memory database can be used:

```
mvn verify
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
